# Model-Collapse

This repositoru contains the code for all the simulations discussed in the paper, 'Rate of Model Collapse in Recursive Training.' In this study, we analyze the rate of model collapse during recursive training in Bernoulli, Poisson, and Gaussian settings. This analysis can also be extended to applications such as n-gram language models, and Gaussian Mixture Models.
